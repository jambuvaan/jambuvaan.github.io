India is a country with rich natural resources with climatic conditions that are favorable for agriculture through major part of a year. India can cultivate all types of crops and grains that can meet a significant portion of the world's food supply demands. India is also rich in other natural resources such as iron ore, copper, many other metals, diamonds and precious stones. The strength of India is not only her resources, but also her people. Though, a huge population is barrier to a country's development, rich and skilled human resources are important need for any country. 

India is a well known largest exporter of rice and other food grains. India supplies a major part of cotton and clothes to the western world and even China. Many multi national companies such as Robert Bosch, Continental, Suzuki, Hyundai and many more have their production plants set up in India, due to availability of cheap labor and resources. These multi national companies export their production to the other parts of the world from India. India also exports silk, indigo dye, salt, tea, coffee and almost any food item you could literally think of. Also, India's software and services exports increased by 16-18% in the financial year 2012 and steadily continue to increase year after year. In the current age of globalization, India is a huge exporter of food, natural resources and services.

Western powers came to india, attracted by her rich natural resources and wealth, rest is the history. India was used as a raw material hub by its colonial rulers, many transport networks by built in the colonial India, mainly for transporting goods. Even after ruthless colonisation for 300 years, India hasn't give up her contribution to the world.  The world has shrunk so much today that each and every one in the world is able to enjoy and get access to anything and everything they want from various parts of the world. In short, India is a very precious gift to the entire world from mother nature.

On the other hand, in today's world, abundant natural resources are not enough for running the country. Technology is dominating the day to day life of every individual and will continue to be so for years to come. India imports a lot of technlogical advancements such as high tech machineries, nuclear reactors, pharmaceutical drugs, consumer electronics and medical equipments from the developed nations. To achieve consistent growth in GDP, India should make efficient and better use of technology, which India is already doing in the service Industry. India provides technology support for many international clients.

Though being world's biggest software exporter, India is still lagging behind in using latest advancements in the information technology industry for managing her own operations. Sure, She is catching up, [IRCTC](http://www.irctc.co.in) would be world's most used, high traffic, ecommerce platform and almost all the ministries and the state goverments have their own web sites. But let's be honest most of these sites are existing for name sake. It's a pity that we have deeply immersed in selling software solutions to other countries, that we have forgot ,that we could make our adminstration and operations, better with all the technology that we sell. 

It has gotten to a situation, that we can no more ignore this gap. This is also affecting the exporters and importers from India. Indian goverment already tries to address this gap by providing various platforms. 


1. [Department of Commerce](http://commerce.nic.in/)
2. [Central Board of Excise and Customs](http://www.cbec.gov.in/cae1-english.htm)
3. [Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics](http://www.dgciskol.nic.in/)
4. [Import Export Data bank](http://commerce.nic.in/eidb/Default.asp)
5. [Daily list from customs](https://www.icegate.gov.in/DailyList/DL)

These platforms, help the Indian traders by providing lot of useful information and notifications related to imports and exports. Still, it is not an easy task for a trader to analyse the global market for a product that he wants to sell. This also prevents the newbees from getting started easily. Since it is difficult to understand the global market for Indian products, foreign trade is always considered as a high risk business.
